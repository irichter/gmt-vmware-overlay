		For unknown reasons, ALSA libraries newer than that generated by >=media-libs/alsa-lib-1.0.28
		instantly crash vmware products.  At least, they do on someone's system, and since not many
		people run vmware anymore (one wonders why, since it works so well, for such a cheap price!)
		the aformentioned someone just assumed it's probably broken for everyone running a Gentoo
		~amd64 system. This package provides an older (=media-libs/alsa-lib-1.0.27*-ish) ALSA
		library, tucked away, harmlessly, in a nonstandard location (/opt/vmware-libasound), which, when
		preloaded by a wrapper script, forestalls the crash, thereby probably costing you or your
		employer a thousand bucks a year, or so, and much, much stress, by allowing one to put off
		the inevitable migration to VirtualBox for just a little bit longer....
